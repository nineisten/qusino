# Qusino: A Decentralized Poker Room on the QUBIC Blockchain

## 1. Executive Summary
Qusino is a decentralized poker room on the QUBIC blockchain, designed to drive transaction volume for U.S.-friendly CEX listings by targeting traditional poker players and crypto enthusiasts, with QUBIC holders joining organically. Built on QUBIC’s fee-less transactions and Useful Proof-of-Work (UPoW), Qusino launches with a retro-chic 2D poker interface featuring a simple table, cards, chatbox, avatars, chips, and buttons to add/subtract funds, sit down, stand up, and exit. QUBIC denominations (bQUBIC, mQUBIC, kQUBIC, QUBIC) simplify transactions. Funded by a smart contract IPO (676 shares) and poker rake (split between stakeholders and development), Qusino will operate in a developer-selected non-restricted jurisdiction. The beta launches in 6-9 months with a lean ~45B QUBIC budget.
